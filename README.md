# ReferralNetworkHub or ReferMe

Welcome to ReferralNetworkHub or ReferMe- The open-source platform for connecting professionals and facilitating job referrals within companies.

## Overview

ReferralNetworkHub is a web-based as well as Mobile-based platform designed to streamline the job referral process. It allows professionals to connect with each other and refer job candidates who may be interested in opportunities within their companies. This platform aims to simplify the referral process, enhance collaboration among professionals, and improve job search outcomes for candidates.

## Problem

Traditional hiring is inefficient, with long recruitment cycles, poor candidate screening, and a lack of incentives for referrals. ReferMe solves this by introducing a referral-based hiring platform where professionals can refer candidates, earn rewards, and conduct short pre-screening interviews. The platform also features hiring reels for interactive job postings and comprehensive resume displays to improve candidate visibility. This community-driven approach streamlines hiring, enhances candidate quality, and incentivizes referrals, benefiting both employers and job seekers.
